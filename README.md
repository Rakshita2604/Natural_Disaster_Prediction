# Natural Disaster Prediction Model

This repository contains an AI model for natural disaster prediction. The model utilizes machine learning and deep learning algorithms to analyze environmental data and provide early warnings for potential natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods, wildfires, and earthquakes. The goal of this project is to enhance disaster preparedness and response efforts by accurately predicting and identifying these events.

## Features

- Collects and preprocesses diverse environmental data including historical records, weather data, satellite imagery, sensor data, and social media feeds.
- Selects relevant features based on domain knowledge and statistical analysis.
- Trains a machine learning or deep learning model using the preprocessed data.
- Integrates real-time data streams for up-to-date predictions and alerts.
- Generates predictions and notifications for potential natural disasters.
- Provides visualization and reporting capabilities to present insights and trends derived from the model.
